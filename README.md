# Spectacle - The KDE Screenshot Utility

Spectacle is a screenshot taking utility for the KDE desktop. Spectacle
can also be used in non-KDE X11 desktop environments.

## Annotation Tool Keyboard Shortcuts

When in annotation mode, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch between annotation tools:

- **S** - Select tool
- **F** - Freehand tool
- **H** - Highlighter tool
- **L** - Line tool
- **A** - Arrow tool
- **R** - Rectangle tool
- **E** - Ellipse tool
- **B** - Blur tool
- **P** - Pixelate tool
- **T** - Text tool
- **N** - Number tool

These shortcuts work when you have an image open in annotation mode, allowing for quick tool switching without using the mouse.
